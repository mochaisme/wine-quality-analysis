# Wine Quality Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the Red Wine Quality dataset to understand the physicochemical characteristics that contribute to wine quality.

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Type: Red Wine Quality Dataset
- Variables: 11 physicochemical properties, 1 quality rating

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Raw dataset
- `R/`: R scripts for analysis
- `docs/`: Project documentation

## Key Findings
- Alcohol content positively correlates with wine quality
- Volatile acidity shows a negative correlation with quality
- Sulfur dioxide levels impact wine characteristics

## Requirements
- R (version 4.x)
- RStudio
- Required R Packages:
  - tidyverse
  - ggplot2
  - cluster
  - caret
  - rpart
  - corrplot

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages
3. Run scripts in the `R/` directory in order
